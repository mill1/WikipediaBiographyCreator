Wikipedia Biography Creator
===========================

**Wikipedia Biography Creator** is a .NET console application that cross-references obituary archives from **The New York Times** and **The Guardian**, applies fuzzy matching to identify overlapping mentions of deceased individuals, and checks whether those individuals already have a biography article on **Wikipedia**.

Results are displayed per month in a clean console UI.
